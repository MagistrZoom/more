Hoi. You are in my silly more implementation repo. Enjoy.

## Posibilities:

Most commands optionally preceded by integer argument k. Defaults in brackets.  Star (*) indicates argument becomes new default.     

    \<space>    Display next k lines of text [current screen size]              
    z           Display next k lines of text [current screen size]*            
    \<return>   Display next k lines of text [1]*\n\                               
    d           Scroll k lines [current scroll size, initially 11]*             
    q           Exit from more    
    =           Display current line number                     
    :f          Display current file name and line number                    
    .           Repeat previous command
